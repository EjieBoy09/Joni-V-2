The Joni Villanueva General Hospital website repository is dedicated to creating a user-friendly online platform that enhances patient engagement and streamlines hospital operations. By integrating CitiCentry for secure patient data management and real-time communication, the website will feature a responsive design, easy appointment scheduling, and a comprehensive information hub for patients and families. Additionally, seamless integration with existing hospital management systems will improve efficiency across departments. This project aims to provide essential resources, support, and updates to the community, ultimately transforming healthcare delivery and ensuring that everyone has access to vital information and services.
